### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze LEGO sets from a **investment perspective**. The analysis includes data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and interpretation of results. We will examine the rate of returns, price variability of LEGO sets over time, correlations between different set characteristics, and the average time needed to sell a set.

### Data

The data comes from Brickeconomy.com, where it was downloaded in CSV format.

### **Project Steps:**

1.	Importing necessary libraries and loading the data
2.	Data cleaning
3.	Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4.	Rate of return
5.	Price variability analysis over time
6.	Correlation analysis
7.	Liquidity analysis

##### **Conclusions**

The analysis shows that investing in LEGO sets can be a stable and profitable option. LEGO sets have low volatility compared to other assets (even lower than gold), are relatively independent of traditional financial markets, and exhibit high liquidity. These characteristics make LEGO sets a unique and valuable addition to a diversified investment portfolio. Despite some data limitations, the results offer useful insights into the market behavior and investment potential of LEGO sets. See details in a Jupyter Notebook.

### **How to Run**

The code requires Python versions of 3.* and general libraries available through the Anaconda package.

**1.**	Clone the repository.

**2.**	Install the required libraries.

**3.**	Execute the Jupyter notebook.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dafciooo21/lego-investment-analysis
